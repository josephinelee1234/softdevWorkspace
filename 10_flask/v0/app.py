#K10 -- analyzing the different versions of flask sample code
#2021-10-05

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__) # Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?

@app.route("/") # Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
def hello_world():
    print(__name__) # Q2: Where will this print to? Q3: What will it print?
    return "No hablo queso!"  # Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?

app.run()  # Q4: Where have you seen similar construcs in other languages?
                
# This is the same code as K09's sample code. Andy had an issue with loading the Flask site on his home network, but on Stuy's network, it worked. We tried to reproduce, but no luck, as it seems to be a Python install not taking effect or a reboot that was needed (which occured before class Monday). Once the website worked, the return statement returned to the web page.
# A warning is thrown on the fact that it is a development server and not push it to production though.
