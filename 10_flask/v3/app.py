#K10 -- analyzing the different versions of flask sample code
#2021-10-05

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__) #create instance of class Flask

@app.route("/")       #assign fxn to route
def hello_world():
    print("about to print __name__...")
    print(__name__)   #where will this go?
    return "No hablo queso!"

app.debug = True
app.run()

# Terminal outputs that flask is restarting with stat, debugger is active, and a process ID? The existing print statements continue to print out content, and the web page continues to say "no hablo queso!".
# A warning is thrown on the fact that it is a development server and not push it to production though. Kinda ironic because the app is set to debug mode.
