Data modeling: 
a way to organize fields in a document to support your application performance and querying capabilities

upsert:
-By default upsert is set to false.
-When upsert is set to true and the query predicate returns an empty cursor, 
the update operation creates a new document using the directive from the query predicate and the update predicate.
-When upsert is set to false and the query predicate returns an
 empty cursor then there will be no updated documents as a result of this operation.
