K13: Template for Success - Serves a templated page
2021-10-08

Things learned:
- trial and error with testing code that we're not sure of is a great way to learn what the code does
  - w3schools.com has a Tryit Editor that allows you to do exactly that and makes changing edits and running new code to try it very easy
- title and heading are different things
- the html template file has to be in a folder called templates or else it doesn't work
- not all variables in the template have to be called in the parameters of render_template call, if a variable is not used, it simply does not show up in webpage
- the head is the part that is not displayed in the web page, that is for body

EGO:
- Learn to get more eyes on your code
- Don't take errors personally, don't be defensive 
- no ego on the original code programmer, and no ego on the code reviewer
