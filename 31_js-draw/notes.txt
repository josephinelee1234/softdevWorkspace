K31 -- JS animation
2022-02-16

- To make the dot continuously update, we added:
  requestID = window.requestAnimationFrame(drawDot);
- in drawDot, it wasn't clearing the previous circles properly. To fix this, we added:
  ctx.beginPath();
- In order to stop accelerating the animation when the animation button was clicked multiple times, we added:
if (requestID) {
    window.cancelAnimationFrame(requestID);
  }
- To stop the animation, we added:
  window.cancelAnimationFrame(requestID);
