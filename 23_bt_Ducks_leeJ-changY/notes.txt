Q0
- Yes. We verbally consulted Team Softlocked with questions specific to Sass and their key features in the website. We asked them how their tables worked.

Q1
- We prefer Bootstrap! It seems like it has all of Foundation's most useful features, and it's also very clear and easy to read within the code. The jumbotron feature is a very nice addition. Bootstrap wins!
