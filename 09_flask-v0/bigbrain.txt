Q0: We have seen similar syntax in Java when learning about inheritance.
Q1: '/' usually describes the path to a particular file. '/' signifies going into a subfolder.
Q2: _name_ will print to the terminal.
Q3: No, this will not appear anywhere. Nothing is being printed; the function hello_world
is simply returning it. We can use return values elsewhere, but it won't be printed automatically.
Q4: .run() is also seen in Python and in Java. However, in Java, run() 
would refer to a method written by the user.
