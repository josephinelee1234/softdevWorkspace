Chapter 3: Creating and Manipulating Documents

From quizzes:

How _id gets assigned to a document:
-You can select a non ObjectId type value when inserting a new document, as long as that value is unique to this collection.
-It is automatically generated as an ObjectId type value.

Insert errors:
-If a document is inserted without a provided _id value, then the _id field and value will be automatically generated for the inserted document before insertion.
-MongoDB can store duplicate documents in the same collection, as long as their _id values are different.

Insert example:
db.pets.insert([{ "pet": "cat" }, { "pet": "dog" },
                { "pet": "fish" }])

Updating documents example:
{ "_id": 1,
  "pet": "cat",
  "fur": "soft",
  "claws": "sharp",
  "name": "Furball" }

Updating documents in shell example:
db.pets.updateMany({ "pet": "cat" },
                   { "$push": { "climate": "continental",
                                "look": "adorable" } })

-removing all collections in a database also removes the database

How to delete a collection:
db.<collection_name>.drop()
