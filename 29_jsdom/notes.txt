- used event listener after consulting with Yaying in period 1
- "listens" for the click, so when you click the button, it will call the change functions that we specified in the js file.
- made sure the inputs would be displayed in the console log
- user inputs can be directly changed by editing the js file
- instead of making the buttons in the js file, we decided to make the buttons in the HTML file and used document.getElementByID(<button name>) and set that equal to a variable called the function's item
