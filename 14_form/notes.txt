K14: Form and Function
2021-10-14

Predictions:
* app will be __name__ by default
* request would be from our html form
* since the request.args is a dictionary we can predict that the html form inputs will be put as values into the dict

Discoveries:
* printed into the terminal
* app was printed as "<Flask 'app'>" not as __name__
* requesting results from local flask host
* after inputting into the html form, the name became the key and our input became the values
* request.headers returns local host, user-agent, and more?
