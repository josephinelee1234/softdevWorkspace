-"Does foo just not have a file extension?"
	-okay, let's just open it then
	$nano foo
	$gedit foo
	$cat foo
-Is there a windows equivalent for cat?

Predictions:
-When we access the file via the localhost link, we predict that the computer will download the file. 
    - Andy experimented with the link and added .txt to the end of the link and also as the file extension - when he did this, the web browser printed the text in the text file.

Observations:
-When we copied the link in foo and we went to the local host, the web page prompted us to download the file foo (plain text).
-Whereas when we went to foo.html, the website loaded the phrase "Is this plaintext, though?," but it didn't prompt us to download any files.
